# Daily Quotes
Flutter App for Daily Quotes

Written in Dart/Flutter, using a custom API for Quote Data (based on [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) API) and [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php) API to generate Quotes of famous persons throughout history and get information about the author via Wikipedia.
Added simple Animations and changing Colors to make it more soothing for the eye.

Core Packages used:
 - Dio (for Http Network Request)
 - Bloc (used Cubits for Quote Data/State Management)
 - Json Serializer/Annotations (to parse Wikipedia API Responses)
 - Auto Route (Routing between different Screens/Widgets)
